# Secure RFID Access Control

The aim of this project is to make a secure access control system to open my front door with Mifare RFID tags.
I would also like to try to incorporate a fingerprint module and wifi module to open the door through telegraph.


So far I have got;
1.  ELEGOO UNO (Same as Arduino Uno but cheaper)
2.  MFRC-522 RFID IC Card Inductive Sensors Module 
3.  Micro SD Card Module 
4.  WS2812B 5050 RGB LED Strip 30 LEDs/M ws2812 IC Individual Addressable 5V
5.  ESP8266 ESP-01 Serial WIFI Wireless Transceiver Module

And I've ordered;
1.  FPC1020A Capacitive Fingerprint Identification Reader 
1.  I2C RTC DS1307 AT24C32 Real Time Clock Module 

Any help or sugestions would be appreciated.
